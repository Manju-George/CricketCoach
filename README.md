# CricketCoach
Flask app to analyse players performance during cricket training session.

The app is in its initial days. The idea for the app is demonstrated in this application.
1. A cricket coach can input player's performance on a training day.
  1.1. Score batsmen within a range of 1-3 for each balls they face.
  1.2  Score bowlers within a range of 1-3 for each ball that they ball.
  These inputs will be stored in the database and will be processesed to display various performance graphs.
2. Currently the data is auto generated from a python simulation I wrote.
3. Some examples of the graphs are implemented using the simulated data.
  3.1. Top 5 batsmen during the current season.
  3.2. A line graph to show individual performance statistics for each player.
